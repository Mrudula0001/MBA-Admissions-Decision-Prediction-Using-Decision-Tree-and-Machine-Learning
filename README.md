# MBA-Admissions-Decision-Prediction-Using-Decision-Tree

Problem Statement:
Universities receive thousands of MBA applications each year, making it challenging to make fair, data-driven admission decisions. This project aims to predict the admission status (Admit, Waitlist, or Deny) based on applicants' GPA, GMAT scores, work experience, major, and other demographic and academic factors. By leveraging Decision Tree and other machine learning models, this project provides insights into key admission factors, helps identify areas for applicants to improve, and supports universities in optimizing their admission strategies.


## Overview

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict MBA admission outcomes (**Admit, Waitlist, or Deny**) based on various academic and demographic factors. By analyzing historical admission data, we aim to help universities streamline their selection process and provide applicants with actionable insights to enhance their profiles.

## Problem Statement

Universities receive thousands of MBA applications each year, making it difficult to manually assess each candidate fairly. Our project leverages **Decision Tree** and other machine learning models to:
- Predict **admission status** based on academic performance and demographics.
- Identify key factors that influence acceptance rates.
- Address **class imbalance issues** using techniques like **SMOTE**.
- Provide insights to help institutions improve diversity and inclusiveness.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, balancing class distributions.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing trends in GPA, GMAT, work experience, and demographics.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing **Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting** for prediction.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Comparing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of different models.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using **Grid Search and SMOTE** for optimal results.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Handling)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Models)
- Jupyter Notebook (Development Environment)
